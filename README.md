## Overview
In this two short data science projects, I am trying different Machine Learning methods on Kaggle clinical datasets. 

# 1. Breast cancer classification 
## Introduction
Aim of this analysis is to predict which tumors can be malignant. Used methods are prinicipal component analysis and dimensionality reduction to check for the feature meaningfulness in tumor malignancy prediction. PCA model was then compared to Logistic Regression model. This analysis was conducted using Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. 
## Methods
- Logistic Regression
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

# 2. Heart failure prediction 
## Introduction
objective of this analysis is a selection of the best machine learning model for the dataset and evaluating how well these models perform in predicting the occurrence of death events in patients depending on different clinical features associated with heart failure.
## Methods
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine Classificator (SVC)
