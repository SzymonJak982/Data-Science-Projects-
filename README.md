## Overview
In this two short data science projects, I am trying different Machine Learning methods on Kaggle clinical datasets. 

# 1. Breast cancer classification 
## Introduction
The aim of this analysis is to predict malignancy in tumors. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and dimensionality reduction methods were employed to assess the significance of features in predicting tumor malignancy. The PCA model was subsequently compared to a Logistic Regression model. This analysis was performed using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.
## Methods
- Logistic Regression
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

# 2. Heart failure prediction 
## Introduction
Objective of this analysis is a selection of the best machine learning model for the dataset and evaluating how well these models perform in predicting the occurrence of death events in patients depending on different clinical features associated with heart failure. Data used in this analysis was part of the biomedical research conducted by Chicco and Jurman (*Medical Informatics and Decision Making*, 2020)
## Methods
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine Classificator (SVC)
